1. We have used Python to implement decision tree using the ID3 algorithms.
2. The code is written as Ipython notebooks which can be run in jupyter notebook by navigating to the file.
3. Open the jupyter notebook and click the run cells for all the cells.
4. The user will be asked to provide the following:
	a. path to training dataset
	b. path to testing dataset
	c. path to validation dataset
	d. pruning factor
5. After that, the program will output the decision tree and results.
6. DecisionTreeImplementation is the notebook containing the source code.
